This project converts an earthquake acceleration recording into audio (in .flac format). Alongside the audio you will also get three graphs of the motion and a MIDI file. If desired you can also produce video of a vertical cursor moving across the data to visually track the progress of the audio throughout the earthquake.

** SeisFinder web service has been closed down, I am investigating alternate sources for suitable acceleration recordings **
